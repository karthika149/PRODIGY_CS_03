A **Password Complexity Checker** is a tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of a password based on specific criteria. It ensures that passwords are resistant to common attacks, such as brute force or dictionary attacks, by analyzing their complexity. 

### Common Criteria Assessed:
1. **Length**: A minimum number of characters (e.g., at least 8).
2. **Character Variety**:
   - Uppercase letters (e.g., A-Z).
   - Lowercase letters (e.g., a-z).
   - Numbers (e.g., 0-9).
   - Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %).
3. **Avoidance of Common Patterns**:
   - No repeated sequences (e.g., "aaaa").
   - No common words or predictable patterns (e.g., "password123").

### Purpose:
The tool provides feedback on whether a password meets these standards and suggests improvements, helping users create stronger passwords to protect their accounts from unauthorized access.
